# 🏠 REMS Project Setup Guide

A step-by-step guide to set up and run the **REMS** Laravel project locally using **Laragon**, **Composer**, and **Node.js**.

---

## 🧩 <b>1. Prerequisites Installation</b>

Before starting, install the following tools:

### 🔹 Install Laragon
1. Go to the official site: [https://laragon.org/download/](https://laragon.org/download/)
2. Download **Laragon Full (for PHP)**.
3. Run the installer and install it to `C:\laragon`.
4. After installation, start **Apache** and **MySQL** from the Laragon control panel.
(Laragon used as database, if using PhpMyAdmin, it can work, but you will need to modify the database and insert the default data yourself)
---

### 🔹 Install Git
1. Download from: [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Install with default settings.
(Incase you don't have the git installed only)
---

### 🔹 Install Composer
1. Go to [https://getcomposer.org/download/](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
2. Download **Composer-Setup.exe** (Windows Installer).
3. Install it — it will automatically detect your PHP path from Laragon.
(You can use vscode terminal to download also!)
---

### 🔹 Install Node.js (includes npm)
1. Go to [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. Download the **LTS version** (recommended).

npm -v
```

## ⚙️ <b>2. Clone the Project</b>

# 🌿 Git Branching Guide for REMS Team

Hey team! 👋  
Here’s how we work together using GitHub — without breaking the `main` branch 😆  

---

## 🧩 1. Create Your Own Branch

> Each person should have their own branch, named after you (e.g., `vennise`, `liz`, `weiyang`, `runshi`).

```bash
# Check what branch you’re currently on
git branch

# Create your own branch
git checkout -b yourname
```
```bash
# Example:
git checkout -b vennise
```

## 📤 2. Push Your Branch to GitHub
```bash
# Add and commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Updated my part of the project"

# Push your branch to GitHub
git push origin yourname
```
```bash
# Example:
git push origin vennise
```
## 🔄 3. Keep Your Branch Updated (Pull from Leader’s Branch)
> Before coding each day, make sure your branch is up to date with the leader’s branch!
```bash
# Switch to the leader's branch (e.g., dev or leader)
git checkout leader-branch
```
```bash
# Pull latest updates
git pull origin leader-branch

# Switch back to your own branch
git checkout yourname

# Merge updates from leader into your branch
git merge leader-branch

```
If you see “conflicts”, fix them carefully, then run:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"

```
## 🧠 4. Merge Your Teammate Branch into the Leader’s Branch (FOR LEADER)
> When your work is done, do NOT merge directly to main!
> Merge into the leader’s branch first (e.g., leader or dev).
in terminal:
```bash
git checkout leader-branch
git pull origin leader-branch
git merge yourname
git push origin leader-branch

```
## 🚫 5. Only Leader Commits to main Branch
> Main branch = stable, published version.
> Only your leader (or assigned maintainer) should merge into main.
Team workflow summary:
```css
[ your branch ] → [ leader branch ] → [ main ]
```
---
# 🧠 Tips

1. Use ```bash php artisan migrate:fresh --seed ``` to reset and reseed your database.
2. Use small commits often:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated form validation"

```
3. Always pull before you start coding.
4. **Never commit directly to main.**
5. Communicate with your team if a merge conflict appears.
